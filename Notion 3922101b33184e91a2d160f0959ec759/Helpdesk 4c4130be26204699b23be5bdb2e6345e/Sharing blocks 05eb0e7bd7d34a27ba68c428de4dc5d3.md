# Create “Global” Blocks

In a variety of circumstances, you may want to use the same block on multiple pages of your workspace. Credits, copyrights and calls to action (CTAs) are just a few examples.

With this trick, you can create “global” blocks. Updating one updates them all.

1. Create the initial instance of the block.
2. Click the block’s `⫶⫶` menu and choose `Copy link`.
3. Paste the link in your browser’s URL bar and remove the characters after the last `/` and through the `#`. (Exclude the `/`; include the `#`.)
4. Copy the modified URL and paste it where you’d like the block placed on other Notion pages.
5. Choose `Link to Page`.
6. Modify any instance to update all instances.
